/**
 * The fixture modal: CFB's facts block, and the signal rows under it.
 *
 * CFB had no fixture modal at all — `GamesPage` listed a title and a percentage
 * — so this is the surface spec `2026-10-01-fixture-signals-design.md` §6 means
 * by "under the facts block in each modal". It is also the only place the trust
 * badge can appear for CFB, which matters because the moneyline is the one
 * market in the fleet measured good enough to ship one (390 graded rows, 3 of 4
 * bands over the floor; `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-04-production-measurements.md`).
 *
 * ## Two rules this component exists to keep.
 *
 * **The pick is quoted, never recomputed.** Everything about which number a game
 * shows comes from `GET /facts/{game_id}`, whose `pick_timing` says whether it may
 * honestly be called a pre-kickoff call. A modal that derived its own pick would
 * be free to disagree with the record that is about to be graded.
 *
 * **A signal is an enhancement, never the page.** `signals` is fetched beside
 * the facts, not instead of them: an empty list renders nothing at all (spec §2,
 * "no data, no row"), and a failed request leaves the facts untouched rather
 * than becoming the modal's error state. The same rule is kept on the adapter
 * and the endpoint's side; pinning it here as well is cheap and it is the side a
 * reader actually sees.
